# Product Overview

Kiloween is a Halloween-themed desktop application called "Spooky Study App" that helps students stay productive by transforming procrastination into learning opportunities.

## Core Concept

The app runs silently in the background and periodically interrupts unproductive computer time with a spooky experience: screen shake, darkening, tunnel animation, creature jump scare, and finally an educational question derived from the user's coursework documents.

## Key Features

- Background execution with configurable timing intervals (5-120 minutes)
- Progressive scare sequence: shake → darken → tunnel → jump scare
- Educational question generation from user-provided study materials (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT)
- System tray integration for easy configuration access
- Session management with statistics tracking
- Halloween-themed UI with ASCII art creatures

## Target Users

Students who want to turn their procrastination breaks into productive learning sessions through gamification and surprise educational content.
