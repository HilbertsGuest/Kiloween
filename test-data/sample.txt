Chemistry Notes - Atomic Structure

An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element.

Atomic Components:
- Protons: Positively charged particles in the nucleus
- Neutrons: Neutral particles in the nucleus
- Electrons: Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus

Atomic Number: The number of protons in an atom's nucleus
Mass Number: The sum of protons and neutrons

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.

Example: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon.
