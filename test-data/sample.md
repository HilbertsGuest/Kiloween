# Biology Study Notes

## Cell Structure

The cell is the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells.

### Prokaryotic Cells

Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Examples include bacteria and archaea.

### Eukaryotic Cells

Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Examples include animal and plant cells.

## Mitochondria

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. They produce ATP through cellular respiration.

Key features:
- Double membrane structure
- Contains its own DNA
- Site of aerobic respiration

## Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

The equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
