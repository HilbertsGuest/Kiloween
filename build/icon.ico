PLACEHOLDER ICON FILE

This is a placeholder. For production builds, replace this with a proper .ico file.

See build/README.md for instructions on creating a proper icon.

The icon should be a multi-resolution .ico file with sizes:
16x16, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256

For now, this placeholder allows the build configuration to be tested.
